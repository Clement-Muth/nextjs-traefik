# Traefik Integration with Next.js App

## Overview

This repository serves as a guide and configuration setup for integrating [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) with a Next.js application WITHOUT docker. The goal is to implement Traefik as a reverse proxy and load balancer, providing a customized host, such as "nextjs.localhost." Additionally, the setup includes TLS integration for secure HTTPS access, utilizing a certificate generated by [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Traefik
- Mkcert

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate Traefik with your Next.js app:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Clement-Muth/nextjs-traefik.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nextjs-traefik
   ```

3. Generate SSL certificates using mkcert:

   ```bash
   mkcert -uninstall
        sudo rm -rf /etc/ssl/certs/mkcert*
        mkdir -p certs/root
        mkcert -cert-file certs/cert.pem -key-file certs/key.pem "nextjs.localhost"
        mkcert -install
   ```

4. Update Traefik configuration in the `traefik/dynamic.yaml` file as needed.

5. Run traefik:

   ```bash
   traefik --configFile=traefik/traefik.yaml
   ```

6. Access the Next.js app using the configured host:

   ```bash
   https://nextjs.localhost
   ```

## Configuration Details

### Traefik Configuration (`traefik/dynamic.yaml`/`traefik/traefik.yaml`)

Adjust the Traefik configuration based on your requirements. This file includes settings for entry points, middleware, and SSL certificates.
